# ls

#### An implementation in Go.

### Flags

Just running the build in its default state (without any args/flags) will output the current working directory's contents.
You can further use these flags to extend the build's functionality.

- `-i` to get the type of the entry (file or directory)
- `-r` to get all the content from directories and sub-directories recursively.
